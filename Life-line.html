            <span>What is Depression?</span><br>
            <span>
                Depression is a common mental health condition that affects how a person feels, thinks, and handles daily activities. 
                It involves a persistent low mood, sadness, or loss of interest in things that once felt enjoyable.
                It is more than a regular bad day or normal mood changes — depression lasts longer and can impact sleep, energy, motivation, and overall well-being.

                Try grounding techniques (holding something cold, noticing 5 things you can see, etc.).
                Seek a safe distraction like listening to calming music or talking to someone you trust.
                Remove or step away from anything that could cause harm.

            <span>What is Anxiety?</span><br>
            <span>
                Anxiety is a feeling of worry, fear, or tension. It can be triggered by real or imagined threats.
                When anxiety rises, the body activates its natural fight, flight, or freeze response, which can cause physical symptoms like a racing heart, shaking, or trouble breathing.
                Everyone feels anxious at times, but anxiety becomes a concern when it is strong, frequent, or affects daily life.

                Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) is a mental health condition that can develop after experiencing or witnessing a traumatic event.
                People with PTSD may experience flashbacks, nightmares, strong anxiety, or intrusive thoughts about what happened.
                Although many people feel distress after trauma, PTSD is diagnosed when symptoms last longer than a month and make everyday life difficult.

            <span>
                Eating disorders are serious conditions that affect a person’s relationship with food, body image, and emotions.
                They involve challenging thoughts and behaviors around eating and can impact physical, mental, and social health.
                Common types include anorexia nervosa, bulimia nervosa, binge eating disorder, ARFID, OSFED, pica, and rumination disorder.
                Eating disorders are treatable, and recovery is possible with the right support.

                Types of eating disorders 
                Anorexia Nervosa – severe restriction of food and fear of weight gain.
                Bulimia Nervosa – cycles of bingeing and compensatory behaviors.
                Binge Eating Disorder – recurring episodes of consuming large amounts of food.
                ARFID – limited intake due to sensory issues or fear of consequences.
                OSFED – disordered eating that doesn’t fully match other categories.
                Controlling your environment
                Try to maintain a safe and structured routine around meals.
                Avoid triggering media or conversations about body weight.
                Surround yourself with supportive people when possible.
                Keep items that comfort you nearby.
                Getting help
                Eating disorders are serious medical conditions — professional care is important.

            <span>
                ADHD (Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder) is a neurodevelopmental condition that affects attention, motivation, and self-regulation.
                People with ADHD may experience difficulties with focus, restlessness, organizing tasks, or controlling impulses.
                ADHD often begins in childhood but can continue into adulthood. 
                With understanding, structure, and support, people with ADHD can learn strategies that help them thrive in daily life.

                Improving inattention
                Break tasks into small steps.
                Use timers or reminders to stay on track.
                Keep your environment organized and minimal.
                Improving hyperactivity
                Let yourself move: stretching, pacing, fidget tools.
                Take short breaks during tasks.
                Use calming activities like deep breathing or music.
                Improving impulsivity
                Pause and count to 5 before reacting when you can.
                Keep a notepad or digital board to jot down thoughts instead of acting immediately.
                Practice routines that support planning and structure.
                Controlling your environment
                Reduce distractions (noise, clutter, screens).
                Use visual supports: calendars, checklists, color coding.
                Create a calm, predictable workspace.

                ADHD professionals can help with diagnosis, strategies, and treatment.
                Support groups, coaching, or therapy can improve daily functioning.

            <span>
                Depression is a common mental health condition that affects how a person feels, thinks, and handles daily activities. 
                It involves a persistent low mood, sadness, or loss of interest in things that once felt enjoyable.
                It is more than a regular bad day or normal mood changes — depression lasts longer and can impact sleep, energy, motivation, and overall well-being.

            <span>
                Anxiety is a feeling of worry, fear, or tension. It can be triggered by real or imagined threats.
                When anxiety rises, the body activates its natural fight, flight, or freeze response, which can cause physical symptoms like a racing heart, shaking, or trouble breathing.
                Everyone feels anxious at times, but anxiety becomes a concern when it is strong, frequent, or affects daily life.

                Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) is a mental health condition that can develop after experiencing or witnessing a traumatic event.
                People with PTSD may experience flashbacks, nightmares, strong anxiety, or intrusive thoughts about what happened.

            <span>
                ADHD (Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder) is a neurodevelopmental condition that affects attention, motivation, and self-regulation.
                People with ADHD may experience difficulties with focus, restlessness, organizing tasks, or controlling impulses.
                ADHD often begins in childhood but can continue into adulthood. 
                With understanding, structure, and support, people with ADHD can learn strategies that help them thrive in daily life.

                Improving inattention
                Break tasks into small steps.
                Use timers or reminders to stay on track.
                Keep your environment organized and minimal.
                Improving hyperactivity
                Let yourself move: stretching, pacing, fidget tools.
                Take short breaks during tasks.
                Use calming activities like deep breathing or music.
                Improving impulsivity
                Pause and count to 5 before reacting when you can.
                Keep a notepad or digital board to jot down thoughts instead of acting immediately.
                Practice routines that support planning and structure.
                Controlling your environment
                Reduce distractions (noise, clutter, screens).
                Use visual supports: calendars, checklists, color coding.
                Create a calm, predictable workspace.
                Getting help
                ADHD professionals can help with diagnosis, strategies, and treatment.
                Support groups, coaching, or therapy can improve daily functioning.
                If ADHD is affecting school, work, or relationships, reaching out for help can make a big difference.

                Depression is a common mental health condition that affects how a person feels, thinks, and handles daily activities. 
                It involves a persistent low mood, sadness, or loss of interest in things that once felt enjoyable.
                It is more than a regular bad day or normal mood changes — depression lasts longer and can impact sleep, energy, motivation, and overall well-being.

            <span>What is Anxiety?</span><br>
            <span>
                Anxiety is a feeling of worry, fear, or tension. It can be triggered by real or imagined threats.
                When anxiety rises, the body activates its natural fight, flight, or freeze response, which can cause physical symptoms like a racing heart, shaking, or trouble breathing.
                Everyone feels anxious at times, but anxiety becomes a concern when it is strong, frequent, or affects daily life.

                If you’re having a panic attack
                Focus on slow, steady breathing (in for 4 seconds, out for 6).
                Name 5 things you can see, 4 you can touch, 3 you can hear, 2 you can smell, 1 you can taste.
                Remind yourself: “This will pass. I am safe.”
                Sit or lie down in a comfortable position.
                Types of anxiety

            <span>
                Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) is a mental health condition that can develop after experiencing or witnessing a traumatic event.
                People with PTSD may experience flashbacks, nightmares, strong anxiety, or intrusive thoughts about what happened.
                Although many people feel distress after trauma, PTSD is diagnosed when symptoms last longer than a month and make everyday life difficult. 
                With support and professional help, people with PTSD can improve and heal.

                Pause and count to 5 before reacting when you can.
                Keep a notepad or digital board to jot down thoughts instead of acting immediately.
                Practice routines that support planning and structure.
                Controlling your environment
                Reduce distractions (noise, clutter, screens).

            <span>
                Depression is a common mental health condition that affects how a person feels, thinks, and handles daily activities. 
                It involves a persistent low mood, sadness, or loss of interest in things that once felt enjoyable.
                It is more than a regular bad day or normal mood changes — depression lasts longer and can impact sleep, energy, motivation, and overall well-being.

            <span>
                Anxiety is a feeling of worry, fear, or tension. It can be triggered by real or imagined threats.
                When anxiety rises, the body activates its natural fight, flight, or freeze response, which can cause physical symptoms like a racing heart, shaking, or trouble breathing.
                Everyone feels anxious at times, but anxiety becomes a concern when it is strong, frequent, or affects daily life.

            <span>
                Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) is a mental health condition that can develop after experiencing or witnessing a traumatic event.
                People with PTSD may experience flashbacks, nightmares, strong anxiety, or intrusive thoughts about what happened.
                Although many people feel distress after trauma, PTSD is diagnosed when symptoms last longer than a month and make everyday life difficult. 
                With support and professional help, people with PTSD can improve and heal.

                If you’re having flashbacks or intrusive memories
                Ground yourself: touch a surface, hold something textured, notice your surroundings.
                Remind yourself: “This is a memory. I am safe right now.”
                Focus on slow breathing or a calming object.
                If possible, move to a safe and quiet place.
                For nightmares or severe anxiety
                Turn on a light or orient yourself in the present.
                Practice a grounding routine or calming activity.
                Reach out to someone you trust if you need support.
                Controlling your environment

            <span>
                Eating disorders are serious conditions that affect a person’s relationship with food, body image, and emotions.
                They involve challenging thoughts and behaviors around eating and can impact physical, mental, and social health.
                Common types include anorexia nervosa, bulimia nervosa, binge eating disorder, ARFID, OSFED, pica, and rumination disorder.
                Eating disorders are treatable, and recovery is possible with the right support.

                Controlling your environment
                Try to maintain a safe and structured routine around meals.

            <span>
                ADHD (Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder) is a neurodevelopmental condition that affects attention, motivation, and self-regulation.
                People with ADHD may experience difficulties with focus, restlessness, organizing tasks, or controlling impulses.
                ADHD often begins in childhood but can continue into adulthood.

                Improving inattention
                Break tasks into small steps.
                Use timers or reminders to stay on track.
                Keep your environment organized and minimal.
                Improving hyperactivity
                Let yourself move: stretching, pacing, fidget tools.
                Take short breaks during tasks.
                Use calming activities like deep breathing or music.
                Improving impulsivity
                Pause and count to 5 before reacting when you can.
                Keep a notepad or digital board to jot down thoughts instead of acting immediately.
                Practice routines that support planning and structure.
                Controlling your environment
                Reduce distractions (noise, clutter, screens).
                Use visual supports: calendars, checklists, color coding.
                Create a calm, predictable workspace.

                ADHD professionals can help with diagnosis, strategies, and treatment.

            <span>
                Depression is a common mental health condition that affects how a person feels, thinks, and handles daily activities. 
                It involves a persistent low mood, sadness, or loss of interest in things that once felt enjoyable.
                It is more than a regular bad day or normal mood changes — depression lasts longer and can impact sleep, energy, motivation, and overall well-being.

            <span>What is Anxiety?</span><br>
            <span>
                Anxiety is a feeling of worry, fear, or tension. It can be triggered by real or imagined threats.
                When anxiety rises, the body activates its natural fight, flight, or freeze response, which can cause physical symptoms like a racing heart, shaking, or trouble breathing.
                Everyone feels anxious at times, but anxiety becomes a concern when it is strong, frequent, or affects daily life.

                Common types include anorexia nervosa, bulimia nervosa, binge eating disorder, ARFID, OSFED, pica, and rumination disorder.
                Eating disorders are treatable, and recovery is possible with the right support.

                Types of eating disorders 
                Anorexia Nervosa – severe restriction of food and fear of weight gain.
                Bulimia Nervosa – cycles of bingeing and compensatory behaviors.
                Binge Eating Disorder – recurring episodes of consuming large amounts of food.
                ARFID – limited intake due to sensory issues or fear of consequences.
                OSFED – disordered eating that doesn’t fully match other categories.
                Controlling your environment
                Try to maintain a safe and structured routine around meals.
                Avoid triggering media or conversations about body weight.
                Surround yourself with supportive people when possible.
                Keep items that comfort you nearby.
                Getting help
                Eating disorders are serious medical conditions — professional care is important.
                Reach out to a doctor, therapist, or nutrition specialist.
                If you feel physically unwell or in danger, seek immediate medical help.

            <span>
                ADHD (Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder) is a neurodevelopmental condition that affects attention, motivation, and self-regulation.
                People with ADHD may experience difficulties with focus, restlessness, organizing tasks, or controlling impulses.
                ADHD often begins in childhood but can continue into adulthood. 
                With understanding, structure, and support, people with ADHD can learn strategies that help them thrive in daily life.

                Improving inattention
                Break tasks into small steps.
                Use timers or reminders to stay on track.
                Keep your environment organized and minimal.
                Improving hyperactivity
                Let yourself move: stretching, pacing, fidget tools.
                Take short breaks during tasks.
                Use calming activities like deep breathing or music.
                Improving impulsivity
                Pause and count to 5 before reacting when you can.
                Keep a notepad or digital board to jot down thoughts instead of acting immediately.
                Practice routines that support planning and structure.
                Controlling your environment
                Reduce distractions (noise, clutter, screens).
                Use visual supports: calendars, checklists, color coding.
                Create a calm, predictable workspace.
                Getting help
                ADHD professionals can help with diagnosis, strategies, and treatment.
                Support groups, coaching, or therapy can improve daily functioning.
                If ADHD is affecting school, work, or relationships, reaching out for help can make a big difference.

                Depression is a common mental health condition that affects how a person feels, thinks, and handles daily activities. 
                It involves a persistent low mood, sadness, or loss of interest in things that once felt enjoyable.
                It is more than a regular bad day or normal mood changes — depression lasts longer and can impact sleep, energy, motivation, and overall well-being.

                If you feel urges to self-harm (SH)
                Pause and take a slow breath.
                Try grounding techniques (holding something cold, noticing 5 things you can see, etc.).
                Seek a safe distraction like listening to calming music or talking to someone you trust.
                Remove or step away from anything that could cause harm.

                Stay in a place where you feel safe and not alone, if possible.
                Reduce overwhelming noise or bright lights.
                Keep comforting items close (blankets, water, soothing objects).

            <span>
                Anxiety is a feeling of worry, fear, or tension. It can be triggered by real or imagined threats.
                When anxiety rises, the body activates its natural fight, flight, or freeze response, which can cause physical symptoms like a racing heart, shaking, or trouble breathing.
                Everyone feels anxious at times, but anxiety becomes a concern when it is strong, frequent, or affects daily life.

            <span>
                Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) is a mental health condition that can develop after experiencing or witnessing a traumatic event.
                People with PTSD may experience flashbacks, nightmares, strong anxiety, or intrusive thoughts about what happened.
                Although many people feel distress after trauma, PTSD is diagnosed when symptoms last longer than a month and make everyday life difficult.

                Improving inattention
                Break tasks into small steps.
                Use timers or reminders to stay on track.
                Keep your environment organized and minimal.
                Improving hyperactivity
                Let yourself move: stretching, pacing, fidget tools.
                Take short breaks during tasks.
                Use calming activities like deep breathing or music.
                Improving impulsivity
                Pause and count to 5 before reacting when you can.
                Keep a notepad or digital board to jot down thoughts instead of acting immediately.
                Practice routines that support planning and structure.
                Controlling your environment
                Reduce distractions (noise, clutter, screens).
                Use visual supports: calendars, checklists, color coding.
                Create a calm, predictable workspace.
                Getting help
                ADHD professionals can help with diagnosis, strategies, and treatment.
                Support groups, coaching, or therapy can improve daily functioning.
                If ADHD is affecting school, work, or relationships, reaching out for help can make a big difference.
