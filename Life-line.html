            <span>What is Depression?</span><br>
            <span>
                Depression is a common mental health condition that affects how a person feels, thinks, and handles daily activities. 
                It involves a persistent low mood, sadness, or loss of interest in things that once felt enjoyable.
                It is more than a regular bad day or normal mood changes — depression lasts longer and can impact sleep, energy, motivation, and overall well-being.

            <span>What is Anxiety?</span><br>
            <span>
                Anxiety is a feeling of worry, fear, or tension. It can be triggered by real or imagined threats.
                When anxiety rises, the body activates its natural fight, flight, or freeze response, which can cause physical symptoms like a racing heart, shaking, or trouble breathing.
                Everyone feels anxious at times, but anxiety becomes a concern when it is strong, frequent, or affects daily life.

                Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) is a mental health condition that can develop after experiencing or witnessing a traumatic event.
                People with PTSD may experience flashbacks, nightmares, strong anxiety, or intrusive thoughts about what happened.
                Although many people feel distress after trauma, PTSD is diagnosed when symptoms last longer than a month and make everyday life difficult. 
                With support and professional help, people with PTSD can improve and heal.

                ADHD (Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder) is a neurodevelopmental condition that affects attention, motivation, and self-regulation.
                People with ADHD may experience difficulties with focus, restlessness, organizing tasks, or controlling impulses.
                ADHD often begins in childhood but can continue into adulthood.

                Improving inattention
                Break tasks into small steps.
                Use timers or reminders to stay on track.
                Keep your environment organized and minimal.
                Improving hyperactivity
                Let yourself move: stretching, pacing, fidget tools.
                Take short breaks during tasks.
                Use calming activities like deep breathing or music.
                Improving impulsivity
                Pause and count to 5 before reacting when you can.
                Keep a notepad or digital board to jot down thoughts instead of acting immediately.
                Practice routines that support planning and structure.
                Controlling your environment
                Reduce distractions (noise, clutter, screens).

                ADHD professionals can help with diagnosis, strategies, and treatment.
                Support groups, coaching, or therapy can improve daily functioning.

                Encouragement
                “Your creativity and energy are strengths.”
                “You can learn new ways to manage things. It’s not too late.”
                “You’re capable of growth — even when it feels messy.”
                “Celebrate the little wins. They add up.”
                Supportive scripts
                “Take one small task and start gently.”
                “You don’t have to do everything at once.”
                “It’s okay to ask for structure and support — it helps.”
